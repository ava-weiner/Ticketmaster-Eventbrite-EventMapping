# Ticketmaster-Eventbrite-Event Search and Mapping
In this project I gather data about events taking place in New York City via the Ticketmaster and Eventbrite APIs. I collected data about the venues where these upcoming events were taking place. The program prints out the name of the event and the date/start time of it. I also created databases for each website that includes information about the events (event id, name, date/time, and category) and venues (venue name, address, longitude and latitude). The search term for this case was "music".

I also made a map of the venues using Tableau and the longitude/latitude data I collected. The map I made showed that most of the upcoming music events will take place in downtown Manhattan. 


# Instructions for running my code:
1.	Make sure datetime is installed by “pip install datetime”
2.	Everything should print once you run the file “master.py”
3.  Open “venue_map.tbw” to see the map.
